## C# Intercept HID input - Manan Patel, BigMercury Inc

I have attached USB keyboard and USB barcode scanner as HID with my PC now I want to intercept input from HID input from the barcode scanner and do data validation & manipulation and then simulate key (submit modified data as keystrokes to any active application to OS)
I want a complete c# code with a detailed remark of all functions the application must run in the background and have options to on and off capturing
